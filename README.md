## Testing

### Validator Testing

- The site was validated using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), which returned no errors.
- CSS validation was performed using the [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpp5-drobota-bd94aa0a3e49.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en), confirming that the CSS code complies with web standards.

### Manual Testing

- **Navigation**: All elements in the navigation bar function correctly and display the intended styling. ![alt Navbar](./staticfiles/build/static/images/navbar.png)
- **Button Functionality**: All buttons are properly linked to their corresponding onClick events, with styling applied as intended. ![alt Buttons](./staticfiles/build/static/images/buttoms.png)
- **Rendering**: HTML elements render as expected across different pages and devices.
- **CRUD Operations**: The Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality operates smoothly throughout the platform.

### Automated Testing

- Backend and frontend tests were conducted to ensure the reliability of core functionalities:
  - **Backend Testing**: Focused primarily on the Post/Offer functionality, ensuring all tests passed successfully.
  - **Frontend Testing**: Concentrated on the rendering of the navigation bar for both logged-in and logged-out users, along with link verification.

### Known Issues

- **Follow/Unfollow Button**: The Follow/Unfollow button does not update its style immediately after being clicked. The style change only takes effect once the user clicks outside the button. [!alt Button bug](./staticfiles/build/static/images/buttonbug.png)


## Used Libraries

- **React Bootstrap**: This project utilizes [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/). for its pre-designed components and consistent styling, streamlining the development process and ensuring adherence to Bootstrap's design principles.
- **Axios**: The [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) library was used to handle HTTP requests. Axios simplifies the process of making API requests and supports promises for managing asynchronous operations, while also automatically handling JSON data transformation.

## Reusable Components

- To promote code maintainability and cleanliness, several reusable components were developed:
 - **Navbar Component**: This component is responsible for displaying links consistently across all pages.
 - **DropDown Component**: Used to facilitate CRUD operations with minimal navigation.
 - **ResourceA Component**: This component displays a spinner or a message when other resources are loading, ensuring a smooth user experience. 

## Deployment

- **Frontend Deployment**:
  The frontend of the Offers24 platform was developed using React and deployed via Heroku. The deployment process involved:
    - Navigating to the Heroku dashboard and clicking on "New."
    - Selecting the deployment method via GitHub and connecting the repository.
    - Ensuring that the frontend project is built using the appropriate environment variables and settings, such as API endpoints and authentication configurations.
    - Deploying the frontend manually from the main branch or enabling automatic deployment for continuous integration.

- **Backend Deployment**:
  The backend of the Offers24 platform, developed with Django, was also deployed on Heroku using the following steps:
    - Setting up the Heroku environment for Django, including the necessary Procfile and requirements.txt to ensure the correct runtime environment.
    - Connecting the backend repository to Heroku.
    - Configuring environment variables for database connections, API keys, and other sensitive credentials through Herokuâ€™s settings.
    - Using CodeInstitute Database creator as the database service in the Heroku environment.
    - Deploying the backend from the main branch, ensuring that migrations were applied, and the application was ready for production use.
