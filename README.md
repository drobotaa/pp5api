### Features left to implement

- **Expiration Attribute**: Introducing a valid_until attribute will enable automatic deletion of posts after a set expiration date, enhancing the timeliness of offers displayed on the platform.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- The site was validated using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), which returned no errors.
- CSS validation was performed using the [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpp5-drobota-bd94aa0a3e49.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en), confirming that the CSS code complies with web standards.

### Manual Testing

- **Navigation**: All elements in the navigation bar function correctly and display the intended styling. ![alt Navbar](./staticfiles/build/static/images/navbar.png)
- **Button Functionality**: All buttons are properly linked to their corresponding onClick events, with styling applied as intended. ![alt Buttons](./staticfiles/build/static/images/buttoms.png)
- **Rendering**: HTML elements render as expected across different pages and devices.
- **CRUD Operations**: The Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality operates smoothly throughout the platform.

### Automated Testing

- Backend and frontend tests were conducted to ensure the reliability of core functionalities:
  - **Backend Testing**: Focused primarily on the Post/Offer functionality, ensuring all tests passed successfully.
  - **Frontend Testing**: Concentrated on the rendering of the navigation bar for both logged-in and logged-out users, along with link verification.

### Known Issues

- **Follow/Unfollow Button**: The Follow/Unfollow button does not update its style immediately after being clicked. The style change only takes effect once the user clicks outside the button. [!alt Button bug](./staticfiles/build/static/images/buttonbug.png)


## Used Libraries

- **Django**: Offers24 uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django was chosen for its ability to handle the backend needs of the project, such as user authentication, database management, and ensuring security while allowing the development of scalable applications.
- **React Bootstrap**: This project utilizes [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/). for its pre-designed components and consistent styling, streamlining the development process and ensuring adherence to Bootstrap's design principles.
- **Axios**: The [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) library was used to handle HTTP requests. Axios simplifies the process of making API requests and supports promises for managing asynchronous operations, while also automatically handling JSON data transformation.
- **Infinite Scroll**: The [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component), was used to implement infinite scrolling, allowing users to scroll through offers without needing to click on "next" or "previous" pages. This improves the user experience by continuously loading content as the user reaches the end of the page.
- **Gunicorn**: [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) is used as the Python WSGI HTTP server for running the Django application in production. It is a robust, lightweight server that is compatible with most web frameworks, and it was selected for its efficiency and scalability in handling multiple simultaneous requests.

## Reusable Components

- To promote code maintainability and cleanliness, several reusable components were developed:
 - **Navbar Component**: This component is responsible for displaying links consistently across all pages.
 - **DropDown Component**: Used to facilitate CRUD operations with minimal navigation.
 - **ResourceA Component**: This component displays a spinner or a message when other resources are loading, ensuring a smooth user experience. 

## Deployment

- **Frontend Deployment**:
  The frontend of the Offers24 platform was developed using React and deployed via Heroku. The deployment process involved:
    - Navigating to the Heroku dashboard and clicking on "New."
    - Selecting the deployment method via GitHub and connecting the repository.
    - Ensuring that the frontend project is built using the appropriate environment variables and settings, such as API endpoints and authentication configurations.
    - Deploying the frontend manually from the main branch or enabling automatic deployment for continuous integration.

- **Backend Deployment**:
  The backend of the Offers24 platform, developed with Django, was also deployed on Heroku using the following steps:
    - Setting up the Heroku environment for Django, including the necessary Procfile and requirements.txt to ensure the correct runtime environment.
    - Connecting the backend repository to Heroku.
    - Configuring environment variables for database connections, API keys, and other sensitive credentials through Herokuâ€™s settings.
    - Using CodeInstitute Database creator as the database service in the Heroku environment.
    - Deploying the backend from the main branch, ensuring that migrations were applied, and the application was ready for production use.
